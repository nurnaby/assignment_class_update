 /*Case Study:

 I have three old hp monitors, not new. I want to sell it on my own website. That’s why I should create a product upload form on my website, then upload my product with specification and available quantity. My monitors have a 15.6 inch display. My monitor’s VGA cable status, yes, I will sell it for 8000 tk.

For creating a product upload form what specifications will be uploaded and what will be their data types?

$quantity=3;//datatype is integer
$monitor_display=15.6;//datatype is double/float 
$vga_cable_status= true; //datatype is boolean 
$product_price=8000; //datatype is integer
